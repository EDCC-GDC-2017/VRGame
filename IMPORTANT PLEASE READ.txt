Please before you commit and push to master please make sure there is not any log files or massive 
pch(precompiled header files) files to prevent errors when you try to push
to master. Also be sure to discard changes in the following folders(in case git does not auto ignore them): saved, build, binaries .
It is important that none of these files go through to the master branch but in case they do i can always revert the commit.

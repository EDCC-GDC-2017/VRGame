IMPORTANT NOTES:

  - Please, before you commit and push to master, make sure there are no log files or massive pch (precompiled header files) files to  prevent errors while pushing. It is important that none of these files go through to the master branch but in case they do, Jeremy can always revert the commit.
  
  - Be sure to discard changes in the following folders (in case git does not auto ignore them):
    * saved
    * build
    * binaries
    
  - Be sure to always synchronize before opening the VR_GAME project to prevent merge conflicts during pushes.

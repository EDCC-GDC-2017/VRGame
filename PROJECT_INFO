  Add any important notes to the section below with appropriate formatting.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

  - Before you commit and push to master, make sure there are no log files or massive .pch (precompiled header) files to prevent errors
    while pushing. It is important that none of these files go through to the master branch, but in case they do, Jeremy can always revert
    the commit.
  
  - Discard any changes in the following folders (in case GitHub does not auto-ignore them):
    * saved
    * build
    * binaries
    
  - Always synchronize before opening vr_game.uproject to prevent merge conflicts during pushes.

  - All game information is written to the Google Document via a link specified above.
